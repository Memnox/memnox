# @memnox/proxy

## 0.9.0

### Minor Changes

- One approval per machine, and one rail for the whole setup run.

  `memnox setup` sent you to a browser for every agent it onboarded, so a laptop
  with five agents asked for five approvals after you had already approved the
  laptop itself. Agents on this machine are now enrolled on the credential that
  first approval produced, through a door the control plane opens only to a
  machine acting for itself. Each agent still holds its own credential, so
  revoking one does not silence the others, and each records the machine that
  vouched for it, so revoking the laptop takes them all. Against a control plane
  that has no such door the browser flow still runs, and the screen says why one
  opened rather than leaving a tab to explain itself.

  Everything the run prints is on one rail now, prompts and enrolment included:
  enrolment had been writing to stdout while the rest drew on stderr, so the one
  step that can block on a person looked like another command interrupting, and
  anything piping `memnox` received it. Paths print under `~`, backup filenames
  are short enough to read, and every wait names its deadline. The approval poll
  now has a floor, because a control plane sending a zero interval left it
  polling as fast as the network would answer.
